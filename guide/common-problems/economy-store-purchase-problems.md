# Economy Store Purchase Problems

In the event that your Economy Store purchase did not go as expected for you. Please let us know and report on our [Discord Server](https://natebot.xyz/discord) support channel! We are very happy to help you with your problem.

Please note that all purchases are final and are mainly irreversible. Some store items may give you the opportunity to refund 50% of the original currency, such as Power Ups.

We will not be accepting any requests for refunds if you are simply "Not Happy" with your purchase, such as comments like "I Dislike this Background, refund me please!".
