The development of Nate Bot was commenced in September of Spring 2018. Nate Bot was successfully completed and went live on December 7th 2018. The success of Nate Bot grew from the server to server... with new developers being hired into building a mighty Discord Bot with the great features. With ever so expanding members using the bot, we are constantly improving the experience by adding new features to the bot.

We would like to thank you for using Nate Bot, a project by NTM Development. We are specialising in creating new content and regular updates to show. To learn more about future updates, please join the [NTM Central Discord Server](https://natebot.xyz/discord).
