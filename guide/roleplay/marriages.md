Once you do so, the confirmation embed will be sent for the other user to confirm by clicking the buttons.

::: warning Caveats:
- If you are married already, you cannot marry another user. You must divorce the existing user before you marry someone else.
- If the user is already married to another user. Wait until they divorce.
- You cannot marry yourself or bots. (Stupid right?)

## Divorcing a User
