# Modify Command Guide
The modify command comes with a series of subcommands that allow you to modify various aspects of your server.

The base command is **`/modify`**.

The <kbd>Manage Server</kbd> permission is required to use this command.

## Server Name
This will allow you to change the server name. The name can be up to 32 characters long and all you need to do is run **`/modify name`**.

## Banner, Icon and Splash Image
This will allow you to change the server banner, icon and splash image. The images sizes are as follows:

- Splash Image: 1920x1080 - 16:9 aspect ratio
- Banner: 960x540 - 16:9 aspect ratio
- Icon: 512x512

You will need to provide a valid image url in the **`image`** parameter so it is recommended that you use a image hosting service such as [Imgur](https://imgur.com/) to upload your images.

Then run the following command(s):
- **`/modify banner <image>`** - Changes the server banner.
- **`/modify icon <image>`** - Changes the server icon.
- **`/modify splash <image>`** - Changes the server splash image.
