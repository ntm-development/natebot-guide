# What are Power-Ups?
Power-Ups are a great way to boosting your Nate Bot experience. This is such as earning double the amount of Game Victories, Giving Reps, Giving Hugs and more! All your Power-Ups that you have active, or not are found by running the **`/view powerups** command.

Purchase Power-Ups through the economy store, and you can sell Power-Ups and get refunded half of it's original price.
