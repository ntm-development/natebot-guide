# The Vault
The vault key can be purchased from the Economy Store for **$80,000** and lets you deposit and withdraws your wallet balance for safe keeping, preventing users who run the **`/play rob`** from being able to steal your money.

To view how much you have in your vault, type **`/vault view`**.
