# How do I get a list of Commands?

You can get a list of NateBot commands by running `/help` and it will display all the command categories like this:

<!-- TODO: Placeholder for image (or) DiscordMessage Components -->

::: tip
These arguments are used when you are running certain commands:

`<>` » Required.<br>
`[]` » Optional.
:::

Now that's all the available categories, you may want to get all the commands of a particular category. It is more organized and easier to find each command.

Just run `/help category <name>` and NateBot will return all the commands for that category!

<!-- TODO: Placeholder for image (or) DiscordMessage Components -->

Finally, if you really want to get specific command help. You can run `/help command <name>` to get information about a command. Here is what it looks like:

<!-- TODO: Placeholder for image (or) DiscordMessage Components -->
