# Bugs and Feedback

Please make sure that the bug or feature is not a duplicate. You can check if someone has reported or suggested already by scrolling through the channel.

Bug Reporting
Send the bug report in our [`#bugs`](https://discord.com/channels/602830493536223232/602831375472787491/810287803790393374) channel using this format:

If you are posting bugs for formatting/typo, we are less likely going to fix it straight away as it is considered a visual error and doesn't affect using NateBot.

If you have found a serious bug and wish not to discuss it in the Support Server, you can message **Nate#1409** on Discord or email [natebotenquiries@gmail.com](mailto:natebotenquiries@gmail.com) with the format above.
