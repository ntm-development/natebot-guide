# Bugs and Feedback

To report bugs or suggest new features, you will need to join our [support server](https://discord.gg/cmUFubKUtu) and send the formatted message in the correct channel.

Please make sure that the bug or feature is not a duplicate. You can check if someone has reported or suggested already by scrolling through the channel.

Bug Reporting
Send the bug report in our `#bugs` channel using this format:

```:no-line-numbers

If you are posting bugs for formatting/typo, we are less likely going to fix it straight away as it is considered a visual error and doesn't affect using Nate Bot.

If you have found a serious bug and wish not to discuss it in the Support, you can email us at [natebotenquiries@gmail.com](mailto:natebotenquiries@gmail.com) with the format above.
