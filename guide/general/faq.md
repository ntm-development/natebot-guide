### Am I allowed to use Alt Accounts on Nate Bot?
Alts are defined as users having two or more accounts to use on Discord, Minecraft or other services.
Some services do allow users to use alt accounts while some **don't allow them.** Discord **doesn't allow** users to use Alt Accounts if their main account was banned.

Using an alt account on Nate Bot is at your own risk, as long as you don't use them to boost your statistics or cheat in any way.

Prepare the **`/set`** command and then pick the detail to edit, a modal will then display for you to fill out.

`/set info` will modify your **About Me** box.

`/set background` will fetch your Nitro Banner and use it as your profile background. (NITRO EXCLUSIVE)
`/set color` will modify the embed color, overlay and other parts of your profile.

### Can I spam commands?
Please do not spam commands. Discord doesn't encourage it and cooldowns are enforced on all users.

### Do you have a source code link?
Nate Bot runs on code that is completely custom and designed in house, therefore the source code is not available.

### Nate Bot has a lot of features that many popular bots have but why the small server count?
While we don't really mind or care about other Bot Server counts, the features it has and everything else, we do care about having Nate Bot be a bot for everyone to enjoy! That is bringing in the best features, commands and updates. We are a small team working hard and maintaining the bot.
