There are many ways to invite NateBot but the most secure way of inviting the bot to your server is by using this [link](https://natebot.xyz/invite). This link is found either by visiting the official website, bot list pages or by running NateBot commands.

Step 1: Visit ​[https://natebot.xyz/invite](https://natebot.xyz/invite).

Step 2: Make sure you're logged into the Browser Version of Discord, or you can use the built-in invite dialog on the Discord Client. That way you can select a server to invite NateBot to your server.

::: danger
Do not fall for fake NateBot Invite Links. These invites may contain permissions (Administrator, Mention Everyone etc.) that can affect your server. We will never ask for those permissions during invitation.

Always use the short invite link as that is the official NateBot Invite and choose the permissions that is best for your server.
