# Who drew the logo?

[FaySilverwood](https://twitter.com/faysilverwoods)! It was created and curated specifically for Nate Bot. We love the logo just as much as her artwork she has made for other people.
Under the strict permission of Fay, we may only modify the logo for special events. Such as Christmas, Easter, Halloween etc.
